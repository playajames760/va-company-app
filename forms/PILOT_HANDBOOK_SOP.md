## 4. Standard Flight Workflow

### 4.1 Preflight

1. Review **Company NOTAMs** and weather (departure, enroute, destination).  
2. Select aircraft appropriate for route and payload.  
3. Prepare route (initial focus on Southern California around KPOC).  
4. Complete paperwork:
   - Cargo Manifest  
   - Dispatch Release  
   - Any maintenance/aircraft status notes  
5. Compute weight & balance and ensure aircraft is within limits.  
6. Brief departure, route, and arrival.

### 4.2 Departure Procedures

- **Towered Airports:**  
  - Request clearance/taxi per local procedures.  
  - Use standard phraseology (e.g., "Brackett Ground, PRA123 at the cargo ramp...").
- **Non-Towered Airports:**  
  - Use CTAF calls: taxi, taking the runway, departing, pattern position reports.
- Follow local noise abatement if published or as role-played by PRA.

### 4.3 Enroute Procedures

- Fly VFR hemispheric altitudes when cruising.  
- Request Flight Following when available.  
- Monitor terrain, airspace, weather, and fuel status at regular intervals.  
- Update fictional "dispatch" (log or text channel) on significant changes (diversions, delays, etc.).

### 4.4 Arrival & Shutdown

1. Obtain arrival weather and brief runway and pattern/approach.  
2. Fly a stable approach, respecting traffic and pattern procedures.  
3. Taxi to cargo ramp / GA ramp.  
4. Unload cargo and complete the Cargo Manifest.  
5. Enter flight data in the Crew/Pilot Flight Log.  
6. Note any aircraft issues for maintenance tracking.

## 6. Abnormal / Emergency Guidelines (Simplified)

> Treat these as role-play guidelines; always apply real-world logic where practical.

### 6.1 Engine Failure After Takeoff

- Nose down – maintain safe airspeed.  
- Land ahead within reasonable turn limits (30°–45° off nose).  
- Mixture/Fuel/Ignition – check if altitude permits.

### 6.2 Engine Failure Enroute

- Best glide speed – establish.  
- Suitable landing site – select (runway preferred).  
- Fuel / Mixture / Magnetos – check.  
- Declare emergency with ATC/CTAF (if online).  
- Secure engine and land.

### 6.3 Weather Deterioration

- Turn back or divert to better conditions.  
- Consider requesting IFR assistance if simulating.  
- Avoid scud-running or unrealistic risk-taking.

## 7. Company Policies

- **Minimum VFR Weather (suggested):** Set your own, e.g.:  
  - Day: 3 SM visibility, 1500 ft ceiling.  
  - Night: 5 SM visibility, 2500 ft ceiling.  
- **Crosswind Limits:**
  - Example C172: 15 kt demonstrated crosswind (adjust to comfort level).  
- **Night Operations:**  
  - Recommended for experienced pilots only; ensure adequate lighting and weather.  
- **New Pilot Checkouts:**  
  - Suggested: 3 solo PRA flights in KPOC region before expanding routes.

## 8. Records & Reporting

For each PRA flight, pilots should complete:

- Cargo Manifest  
- Dispatch Release  
- Crew/Pilot Flight Log entry  

Optional extras:

- Screenshots of route, landings, or scenic highlights.  
- Sharing flight reports in a community channel.
