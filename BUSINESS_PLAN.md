# ✈️ **PALM ROUTE AIR – BUSINESS PLAN(Virtual Airline for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024)**

**Version 1.0**

---

# **1. Executive Summary**

**Palm Route Air (PRA)** is a small, lean, VFR-friendly virtual(MSFS 2024) cargo operator based at **KPOC – Brackett Field Airport** in La Verne, California. The company’s mission is to provide **flexible, rapid small-parcel logistics** to clients who value fast movement of goods rather than volume. Palm Route Air will fly anything that fits into light GA cargo aircraft—from overnight envelopes and replacement parts to unknown small cargo boxes (fictionalized for gameplay).

The airline will begin operations with **short-haul, VFR cargo hops around Southern California**, gradually expanding west and south into **coastal, desert, and finally tropical territories** as the fleet grows.

Long-term branding: **“Where the coastlines connect.”**

# **2. Business Model**

### **2.1 Type of Operation**

* **Part 135-style on-demand cargo (fictional imitation)**
* Small aircraft, low overhead, high flexibility
* VFR operations preferred; IFR optional in bad weather
* Fast turnaround, minimal airport infrastructure

### **2.2 Revenue Streams**

1. **Contract Cargo Runs**

   * Local shops, medical deliveries, machine parts, documents
   * Paid per flight or per pound

2. **On-Demand Point-to-Point Cargo**

   * Customer requests a delivery anywhere within range
   * Higher rate due to urgency and flexibility

3. **Scheduled Micro-Cargo Routes (later expansion)**

   * Daily or weekly flights between defined airports
   * More predictable cashflow for airline role-play

4. **Tropical Expansion Contracts (future)**

   * Island hopping
   * Resort supply flights
   * Remote community deliveries

# **3. Market Strategy**

### **3.1 Initial Operating Area – Southern California**

KPOC is ideal because it sits in a cluster of small airports:

* KPOC (Brackett Field – HQ)
* KEMT (El Monte)
* KFUL (Fullerton)
* KTOA (Torrance)
* KCRQ (Carlsbad)
* KSEE (Gillespie)
* KVNY (Van Nuys)
* KHND / KVGT (Vegas region for longer runs)

This creates a **dense web of profitable short hops** for cargo simulation.

### **3.2 Expansion Phase 1 – Coastal and Desert**

* Santa Barbara region
* Palm Springs / Thermal
* San Diego and cross-border style fictional ops
* Arizona (Yuma, Phoenix outskirts)

### **3.3 Expansion Phase 2 – Tropical Growth**

Once you want to simulate long-distance repositioning flights:

* Hawaii
* Mexico’s Baja / Gulf coast
* Caribbean (fictional business partner acquisition)
* Central America (Panama, Costa Rica)

Palm Route Air becomes known for **sun-route logistics**—hence the “Palm Route” identity.

# **4. Fleet Plan**

### **Initial Fleet (MSFS-friendly light cargo planes):**

1. **Cessna 172R**

    * Great trainer and entry-level cargo hauler
    * Moderate range for short regional hops
    * Limited but usable small-parcel payload
    * Ideal for 30–120 NM routes and training flights

### **Future Fleet Options**

* Daher Kodiak 100 (STOL + cargo flexibility)
* Twin Otter (for island cargo expansion)
* Beech 1900 / Embraer 110 (regional routes)
* Eventually: ATR 42 or Caravan amphibian variant for island ops

# **5. Operational Planning**

### **5.1 Base of Operations**

**KPOC – Brackett Field (California)**

* Cheap fuel
* Plenty of small hangars
* Perfect GA environment for start-up aircraft
* Easy access to LA basin without steep fees

### **5.2 Flight Rules**

**Primary: VFR**

* Cruise per hemispheric rule
* Use Flight Following when available
* No vectors unless required by ATC for traffic

**Secondary: IFR for weather or high-value contracts**

### **5.3 Cargo Handling Procedures**

* Standardized cargo manifest created before every flight
* Estimated cargo weight + fuel calculations
* Load into aircraft according to center-of-gravity guidelines
* Perform a “cargo lock and secure checklist”
* Log flight (departure, arrival, total cargo weight transported)

---

# **6. Branding and Identity**

### **Company Values**

* **Fast**
* **Flexible**
* **Discreet**
* **Coastal & Tropical Identity**
* **Reliability over luxury**

### **Livery Concepts**

* Palm frond or palm tree motif on tail
* Turquoise + white + sandy gold color palette
* Slogan: **“Delivering the Sunshine.”**

---

# **7. Milestones & Expansion Plan**

### **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–3)**

* Operate between KPOC and nearby airports
* Establish 5–10 regular cargo clients (role-play)
* Build reputation as a quick-response cargo carrier

### **Phase 2 (Months 1–2)**

* Expand to entire Southern California coastline
* Acquire second aircraft
* Begin scheduled micro-routes (e.g., KPOC → KCRQ → KTOA)

### **Phase 3 (Months 3–6)**

* Begin long-range repositioning flights
* Add desert and mountain airports
* Start “Palm Route Express” branded routes

### **Phase 4 (Post 6 months)**

* Tropical operation hubs:

  * PHNL (Honolulu)
  * MHRO (Roatán)
  * TTPP (Trinidad)
  * MBPV (Turks & Caicos)

Palm Route Air eventually becomes a **multi-region niche cargo carrier**, specializing in warm-weather and island delivery.
